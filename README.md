# PD
Phylogenetic Diversity simulations and calculations 

Here (eventually/maybe) you will find documentation about PD.

Written in C++, PD provides tools to analyse Phylogenetic Diversity of phylogenetic trees and targeted portions thereof.

It also generates simulated trees, and simulates the process of discovery of taxa from these trees.

At the moment, it is entirely old school in that it is a command line tool. But it is written in a totally modular way and can/will be called fromR and python.
