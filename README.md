# PD -- Phylogenetic Diversity simulations and calculations  

Here (eventually/maybe) you will find documentation about PD.

Written in C++, PD provides tools to analyse Phylogenetic Diversity of phylogenetic trees and targeted portions thereof.

It also generates simulated trees, and simulates the process of discovery of taxa from these trees.

At the moment (Sep 2017), it is entirely **old school** in that it is a **command line tool** outputting a csv formatted file, and phylogenetic trees in a newick form.

But it is written in a totally modular way and can/will be called from R and Python (when I get some time and opportunity).
